# Working Hours Management System (2015)

This project is intended to be used to monitor working hours for a group of employees. 
This system is based on a pre defined hierarchy of workers, in which a lower-hierarchy-level employee has to specify his working hours, and get his records approved or denied by a higher-hierarchy-level employee. The higher-level employee has a friendly-interface with full functionality section available. 
This system was originally built for ASAT (Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) Students Union), but wasn't completed due to logistic reasons.  

IDEA: 
Each worker in the company get registered and privileged by the system admin (according to his job description). Then, he can log in and enter his personal data, and his daily basis working hours. Each log of working hours is reported to an upper-level employee, and gets confirmed or denied. Several log-files and other salary files can be generated throw the system.

Implementation:
The system is build as a website.
This site uses JSP to handle the server side, SQL database to save user data.
The front end is implemented by HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Also includes BOOTSTRAP elements for better site scalability.
